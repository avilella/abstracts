### Abstract

Bioboxes: bioinformatics apps in standardised containers.

We introduce the open-source **bioboxes** community with the mission
of building a solid catalog of bioinformatics containers. Each "box"
or appplication is easy to install, easy to run and easy to reproduce
the exact results. Bioboxes creates standardised interfaces and
containers, so that each app is available to use with minimal effort,
and can be seamlessly executed like any other app of the same
type. Bioboxes built by community members are validated with our
dind-validator and sent to our free public Docker Hub. Researchers
with this catalog of apps at their fingertips can comprehensively
evaluate many similar tools and improve the quality of their
research. Given the same input data, a system of well-defined bioboxes
is also the first step towards the establishment of provenance records
and making research truly reproducible.

TODO: mention: relationship with CWL workflows.
